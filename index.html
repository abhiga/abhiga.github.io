<h2>Projects</h2>
<p><b>University Course Management System | Java, JDBC, MySQL</b><br>
University Course Management System is DBMS which can be used in managing Courses and Evaluations created in different departments at a University. The program only accepts three types of users: admin, faculty and student. Each type of user has a different access permission and thus the functionality of the whole program depends on the type of user.</p>

<p><b>FileInfo (CloudShare Web application) | HTML5, CSS, Parse, NodeJs, AngularJs, IBM Bluemix</b><br>
Developed a web application where users can share files anonymously among their friends by sharing the link of the file generated. The web application also tells the details of the extension of the file and which software can be used to open it on different operating systems. </p>
<p><b>Web Server | C, C++</b><br>
Developed a web server application which users can use to host their website on any computer. It also provides options of different concurrency modes such as pool of threads and processes which users can tweek according to their needs .
<p><b>Simplified Linux Shell | C, C++, LEX, YACC</b><br>
Created a simplified Linux Shell which provide similar functionality as Bash. </p>
<p><b>Memory-Allocator | C, C++</b>  <br>
Implemented my own basic memory allocator functions which provides similar functionality as Malloc, Calloc, Realloc and Free functions.  </p>
<p><b>WebCrawler & SearchEngine | C, C++, FSM</b><br>
Developed a WebCrawler application which parses TITLE and META tags from HTML pages. It then creates a hashmap of these words with the linked list of index of URLs stored. The SearchEngine application can then be used to run queries of words on the data parsed by WebCrawler. The above applications can be used together to search any public data on a Website.  </p>
<p><b>Chat Server & Chat Client | C, C++, GTK+</b><br>
Developed a Chat Server & Chat Client application which multiple users can use to connect and chat with each other. Chat Client lets users to signup, login, create chat rooms, join chat rooms, view online users in a particular chat room and send messages.   </p>
<p><b>Purdue EPICS (A Fresh Start) Team Project | HTML, PHP, MySQL, phpMyAdmin</b><br>
Was developing a web application for 'A Fresh Start' (previously Soap & Towel Campaign) to track donations for Homeless shelters. I worked on that part of the web application where donors can signup, login and update their profile.
<p><b>Safewalk Server & Safewalk Android application | Java </b> <br>
SafeWalk is a system used at Purdue to help people get home safely at night if they feel unsafe, or to call the police if there's been an emergency and they have no other way to contact the authorities. Our final project in CS180 is to implement a replica of this system using a server and an android app. On the app, users can select their location, and their required destination, or call for emergency help. This request goes to the server, and then gets sent as a notification to the nearest volunteer walker who will then go to the requester and escort them home. Emergency help dials the Purdue Police department.
